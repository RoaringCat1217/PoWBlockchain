# Lab 4: Choose-your-Own Distributed System

As indicated in the lab writeup, you have an opportunity to design and implement your own distributed system, service, or application.  There is a lot of flexibility, so we aren't providing you with starter code.  This nearly empty repo should be your starting point, and you can build off any of your previous lab outcomes.  As usual, please use this repo for your project work, so the course staff can help you along the way

## Description of tests and how to run them
To start the tests, use the following command:
```
make test
```
This command will run all the tests defined in the Makefile.
Please note that the success of the tests is closely related to the computing power of your CPU. The tests involve mining blocks, which require significant computational resources. If you encounter test failures, it may be due to the target difficulty being too high for your system to complete the mining process within the specified timeout.
